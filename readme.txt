README.txt for the test .calc programs

The following programs are available and should produce the following results.

gcd.calc - Computer the greatest common divisor between 732 and 2684 using Euclide's original algorithm. Also tests your implementation of 'gcd' by a direct all and printout of the result.
           Should produce the result 244.

harmonic.calc - Print the harmonic number summing the first 1 million terms. Answer: 14387. 

looptest.calc - Loop over the first 101 numbers, printing each on a line by itself starting from 100. Output:
                100
                99
                ...
                1
                0

pi.calc - Computer the value of pi using fixed point arithmetic, answer: 314156, using Leibniz formula.

fact.calc - Prints the result of your factorial implementation
	  Should printout the value 0 twelve times.
